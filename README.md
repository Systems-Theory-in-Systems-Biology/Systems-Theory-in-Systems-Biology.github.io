Repository of the Systems Theory in Systems Biology Group of the University of Stuttgart. 

Head of Group is Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Nicole Radde.

Our research focuses on the modeling and analysis of intracellular regulation processes. The ultimate goal is the development and application of mathematical methods to facilitate a better systemic understanding of these processes for particular subsystems and the organization of molecular regulation mechanisms in general. I.e. these methods try to catch the dynamics of the underlying system, the stochasticity of the process, population phenomens and capture the uncertainty in the model parameters and predictions.To achieve this goal our group works in close collaboration with partners from molecular and cellular biology and mathematics.
